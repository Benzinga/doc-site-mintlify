Good morning and thank you for joining Thurmond Group fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2025 results conference call Leading the call today are CEO Bruce Thames and Chief Financial Officer Jan Schott. Earlier this morning we issued an earnings press release which has been filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Additionally, the slides for this conference call can be found in our IR website under News and Events IR Calendar Earnings Conference Call Q4 2025 during the call we will discuss some items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles. We have reconciled those items to the most comparable GAAP measures in the tables at the end of the earnings press release. These non GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. I would like to remind you that during this call we might make certain forward looking statements regarding our company. Please refer to our Annual Report and most recently Quarterly report filed with the SEC for more information regarding our forward looking statements including the risks and uncertainties that could impact our future results. Our actual results might differ materially from those contemplated by these forward looking statements and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as might be required by law. Today's call will begin with remarks from our CEO Bruce Thames who will provide a review of our recent business performance including an update on the progress we have made on our strategic initiatives, followed by a financial update and review from our CFO Jan Schott. Bruce will then wrap up our prepared remarks with an update on our business outlook at the end. At the conclusion of these prepared remarks we will open the line for questions. With that I'll turn the call over to Bruce."

The company achieved a 22.7% EBITDA margin, up 423 basis points year-over-year, and ended fiscal 2025 with a net leverage below one, highlighting strong financial discipline and operational excellence.\n\n- Strategic initiatives focused on diversification, decarbonization, and digitization have contributed significantly to growth, with the acquisition of Vapor Power and FATI expanding market opportunities. The company achieved a 20% organic backlog increase, driven by strong bookings in LNG and diversified markets, and has a favorable book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 times.\n\n- For fiscal 2026, Thurmond anticipates revenue growth of 3.5% at the midpoint, despite potential margin headwinds from tariffs, which are expected to have a net impact of $4-$6 million. The company plans to offset these through pricing actions and operational efficiencies, while maintaining a strong focus on capital allocation for growth, including strategic M&A and share repurchases.",
