title: "TCP Newsfeed v1.1 (Deprecated)"
---
Use [Websocket API](/benzinga-apis/newsfeed-stream-v1/newsfeed-stream-v1) or [Webhook delivery](/benzinga-apis/webhook/webhook-v1).

If your news integration requires the TCP service, we highly recommend using our [Python TCP client](https://github.com/Benzinga/python-bztcp) or our [Go TCP client](https://github.com/Benzinga/go-bztcp).

## Line Endings
All lines endings will be in the expected format:

=BZEOT\r\n


## Commands
All commands that return or send data will include a colon (:) and possible whitespace ( ) between the command and the data.

**Note:** A single whitespace was required and will now be deprecated.


## Connection

All clients are given a username and key to connect with. Only one connection is allowed from a username/key at any given time.

Once connected, the server will reply with **READY**

on **READY**, send an **AUTH** token in the form:
```
AUTH: {
  "username": "<username>"
  "key": 1234567890
}
```
The server will reply `CONNECTED`, if the connection is valid, otherwise disconnect.

### Example: 
```
SERVER> READY=BZEOT\r\n
    
    CLIENT> AUTH: {"username": "username", "key": "1234567890"}=BZEOT\r\n
    
    SERVER> CONNECTED=BZEOT\r\n
```

### No Authentication Received
Clients will receive the following disconnect message if no authentication message is received:
```
Goodbye=BZEOT\r\n
```

### Failed Authentication
Clients failing authentication will receive the following message(s):
```
INVALID KEY=BZEOT\r\n
INVALID KEY FORMAT=BZEOT\r\n
```

### Multiple Connections
If multiple connections are needed in your environment, please contact us.

Multiple connections with the same Username/Key will result in a disconnect:
```
DUPLICATE CONNECTION=BZEOT\r\n
```


## Keep Alive
### Client Initiated
After successful connection, a client should send a keep alive by sending PING: along with the pingTime in JSON format. The pingTime will be returned in the response by the server, along with the server time in UTC. The pingTime may be in any string or numeric format and in only used as the response token.

### Example
```
CLIENT> PING: {"pingTime": "VALUE"}=BZEOT\r\n
    
    SERVER> PONG: {"serverTime":"Thu Sep 20 2012 01:02:51 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "pingTime":"VALUE"}=BZEOT\r\n
```


## Data
Once connected, article Data will be streamed in JSON format. The following data will be available:
### Example
```
STREAM: {
