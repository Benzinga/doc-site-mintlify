JWT, Refer [Benzinga JWT](https://github.com/Benzinga/jwt) for more information. For JWT, we recommend using RS256. You may generate sample JWT using https://jwt.io/. You need to send us public/private key depending upon which algorithm you are using. We will add that public/private key on our side, so it will verify signature generated. Also, you need to send us the value of iss (issuer) value of payload.

**Note:** Prepend **Bearer** to your actual jwt when you authorize here to test.

**Type:** apiKey
