Welcome to the [Benzinga Cloud](https://cloud.benzinga.com/) Developer Documentation portal. Here you will find documentation for the our news, market, and company data APIs. If you have any questions please [reach out to us](support@benzinga.com). We love to help.
## About this Documentation

For our REST APIs, this documentation is powered by OpenAPI specifications. You can view the raw yaml spec by clicking on the "spec" links in the navigation sidebar.

An integrated REST client is embedded directly in the "Playground" section of each page powered by OpenAPI. Once you have obtained an API key, you can test calls without leaving the documentation portal. Alternatively you can test calls with any other GUI REST clients ([Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), [Paw](https://paw.cloud/)) or CLI tools like cUrl1.

Finally, the OpenAPI specifications are compatible with tools in the Swagger ecosystem, so you can even [generate a client for the programming language of your choice](http://swagger.io/swagger-codegen/).

## Best Practices

We suggest that customers use our Benzinga-provided clients when possible. Many endpoints are available in our Python library DONT FORGET TO LINK THIS. And we provide example implementations and client libraries via our public [Github](https://github.com/benzinga).

Finally, we highly recommend employing deltas while using the Calendar, Signals, and News APIs -- particularly while using them for real-time ingestion (as opposed to ingestion of historical data). This can be done by employing the `parameters[updated]` query parameter for the Calendar and Signals APIs, and the `updatedSince` query parameter for the News API. Use of these parameters ensures minimal latency.
